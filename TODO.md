- Does Girault-Raviart theorem with Helmholtz decomp. help?
- Harmonic vector fields, find up to date reference
- Look at application of Sperner's lemma
- Look into James Kelliher, stream functions for divergence free vector fields. Relation to differential forms.
- Perhaps give a classical example of a Morse function to determine the Betti numbers.
- Insert figure of that diffeomorphism.
- rework figures
- possibly add to literature: Braess, Mond and Ballesteros - Singularities of mappings
- Look up Floer homology and Conley index theorem
- add literature, check that all literature is used.
